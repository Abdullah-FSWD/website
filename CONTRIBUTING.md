## Posts

The Devs blog is an [open source](https://github.com/TheDevs-Network/website/tree/master/posts) blog and **everyone** can publish their aricles in the blog, but first it should match our guidelines.

### Choosing a subject

Before starting to write anything, make sure the subject you're choosing is interesting enough and has the ability to let us write **high quality** content for it. 

And since the blog is pretty fresh, try to choose **trendy** subjects for trendy languages, which will bring more visitors and help them discover our community.

With that said, if your're unsure about the subject, you can open an issue and ask for feedbacks.

### Format

Our blog posts are in markdown format. So you should write in markdown as well.
